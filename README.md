Dijkstra's Algorithm
This code provides a demonstration of Dijkstra's Algorithm, which creates finds the shortest path between any two vertices on a graph. This program in particular uses a DIRECTED graph with both time and cost variables. The path can be found by either lowest cost or shortest time. The graph data is input through the file 'data.dat' and the request data is found in 'request.dat'.

Data is entered in 'data.dat' in the following format:
<# of following inputs>

\<destinationA>|\<destinationB>|\<cost>|\<time>

Data is entered in 'request.dat' in the following format:
<# of following inputs>

\<starting_vertex>|\<ending_vertex>|\<C: by cost or T: by time>
